1,0000 - cctns,FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION V1.0 (DRAFT)
2,0000 - cctns,The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) report provides the detailed description of the functionalities required for the first version of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” and “Detection of Criminals”.
3,0000 - cctns,DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
4,0000 - cctns,"Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants."
5,0000 - cctns,"The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted.         The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclosures."
6,0000 - cctns,NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
7,0000 - cctns,The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the application.
8,0000 - cctns,The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.
9,0000 - cctns,The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter.
10,0000 - cctns,"The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert."
11,0000 - cctns,The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request.
12,0000 - cctns,"The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and age- wise."
13,0000 - cctns,The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface.
14,0000 - cctns,"An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters. The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about:"
15,0000 - cctns,"Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them."
16,0000 - cctns,"The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers."
17,0000 - cctns,"The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system."
18,0000 - cctns,The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without affecting the audit trail stored by the System). This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.
19,0000 - cctns,"The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A user’s attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms."
20,0000 - cctns,The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised:
21,0000 - cctns,The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address.
22,0000 - cctns,"The requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences, files, and records and various functionalities provided within the system."
23,0000 - cctns,The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or user groups.
24,0000 - cctns,The system should provide for role-based control for the functionality within the system
25,0000 - cctns,The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group.
26,0000 - cctns,The System must allow only admin-users to set up user profiles and allocate users to groups.
27,0000 - cctns,The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases.
28,0000 - cctns,"The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user."
29,0000 - cctns,"If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time):"
30,0000 - cctns,"If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access."
31,0000 - cctns,"If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases, it must log these in the audit trail."
32,0000 - cctns,"Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery."
33,0000 - cctns,"All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them. Ideally, each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) which the user can take in response to the error."
34,0000 - cctns,"The System must employ a single set of user interface rules, or a small number of sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application."
35,0000 - cctns,"The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously."
36,0000 - cctns,"The interfaces must be made customizable or user-configurable to the extent possible. (e.g., the displayed columns in the table, move, resize, modify the appearance). Such configurations must be saved in the user profile."
37,0000 - cctns,"The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs; that is, compatible with specialist software that may be used and with appropriate interface guidelines"
38,0000 - cctns,The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout.
39,0000 - cctns,The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable. These defaults should include:
40,0000 - cctns,Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks).
41,0000 - cctns,"Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it. Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes:"
42,0000 - cctns,The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive.
43,0000 - cctns,The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.
44,0000 - cctns,"Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality."
45,0000 - cctns,"Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110."
46,0000 - cctns,Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
47,0000 - cctns,Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.
48,0000 - cctns,"Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account."
49,0000 - cctns,"Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered."
50,0000 - cctns,Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.
51,0000 - cctns,"Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard."
52,0000 - cctns,Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.
53,0000 - cctns,"Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page."
54,0000 - cctns,Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.
55,0000 - cctns,"Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface."
56,0000 - cctns,"Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable."
57,0000 - cctns,"Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171."
58,0000 - cctns,Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.
59,0000 - cctns,"Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points."
60,0000 - cctns,"Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences."
61,0000 - cctns,Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.
62,0000 - cctns,Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines
63,0000 - cctns,Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.
64,0000 - cctns,"Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links — particularly links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems."
65,0000 - cctns,"Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as “go” or “click here” except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand."
66,0000 - cctns,Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked.
67,0000 - cctns,"Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results."
68,0000 - cctns,"Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation)."
69,0000 - cctns,"Use of “white space”: “White space” on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."
70,0000 - cctns,"Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart."
71,0000 - cctns,"Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness)."
72,0000 - cctns,"Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."
73,0000 - cctns,"Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page."
74,0000 - cctns,"Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently."
75,0000 - cctns,Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
76,0000 - cctns,Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.
77,0000 - cctns,Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.
78,0000 - cctns,"Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area."
79,0000 - cctns,Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.
80,0000 - cctns,"Taking account of the users’ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration."
81,0000 - cctns,Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.
82,0000 - cctns,"Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications."
83,0000 - cctns,"Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand."
84,0000 - cctns,The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under www.usability.gov
85,0000 - cctns,The System must be available to users:
86,0000 - cctns,The planned downtime for the System must not exceed <xx> hours per <rolling three month period>.

90,0000 - cctns,The System must provide adequate response times for commonly performed functions under both standard and peak conditions
91,0000 - cctns,"The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records themselves."
92,0000 - cctns,"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use."
93,0000 - cctns,"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 20 seconds the case which has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records."

230,1995 - gemini,Gemini Software Requirements Specification
231,1995 - gemini,The document defines the operational requirements for Gemini Control System software. The goal of the SRS is to provide a functional tool for  guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the Gemini System.  It establishes both general criteria and specific functional requirements for software and controls design in the Gemini Project.
232,1995 - gemini,"It is oriented toward the developers of control and data acquisition systems, not toward the science user of the Gemini telescopes.  As such, it logically follows the Operational Concepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general  perspective. The impacts of the science requirements, as well as requirements of control system design are covered in this document."
233,1995 - gemini,"B.Monitoring. This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be invoked on a subsystem basis. Under no circumstances should monitoring affect the performance of an ongoing observation"
234,1995 - gemini,"E.Testing. Test access allows full, direct control of any subsystem. All features of the subsystem are available in this mode. Under no circumstances should testing affect the performance of an ongoing observation."
235,1995 - gemini,Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities. These are referred to in general as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.
236,1995 - gemini,"These are sites with high bandwidth connections to the super sites. They have remote operations capability but at a reduced level. Will these high bandwidth connections be private or public, or doesn’t it matter? I don’t understand the different between a remote operations facility and a satellite site. Why does the satellite site not just connect directly to the telescope? — Steven."
237,1995 - gemini,"These are sites, generally located at existing observatories, universities, etc. that have some form of connectivity, perhaps via satellite sites and/or super sites, to the telescopes. Although they have remote operations capability, the link capacity will determine at what level."
238,1995 - gemini,User-level requirements
239,1995 - gemini,Each class of users has different needs of the system. The general requirements of each user class are summarized below.
240,1995 - gemini,"Definition Currently, operations staff includes 'night assistants' and staff of the 'operations group'. Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope, and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. These users will be very experienced users of the system. They will be very familiar with the Gemini 8m Telescopes and/or its instruments."
241,1995 - gemini,Purpose of work Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety.
242,1995 - gemini,"Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run."
243,1995 - gemini,"Definition Software development and maintenance are staff: •based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or •based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or •non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute. These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works."
244,1995 - gemini,Privileges Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system. Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation.
245,1995 - gemini,Operation mode Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level  (see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test.  Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode  to support integration tests. This means that a number of commands are available  which allow the hardware concerned to be tested  (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers.
246,1995 - gemini,"This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements  and speciﬁes the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by:"
247,1995 - gemini,they shall be able to take calibration or ﬂat ﬁeld exposures in parallel
248,1995 - gemini,"they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back  to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation)"
249,1995 - gemini,"they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels  (observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3)."
250,1995 - gemini,"Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted  actions to adversely impact the active instrument"
251,1995 - gemini,"It should be a goal, but not a requirement, that the interface provide support for"
252,1995 - gemini,the Gemini standards will evolve over time as requirements and technology change
253,1995 - gemini,the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments  to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system
254,1995 - gemini,Observing model requirements
255,1995 - gemini,"Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini  telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing  efﬁcient use of the telescope. While its requirements include all those given below for service  observing, it has the following special requirements."
256,1995 - gemini,"The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human  interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include  a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should  be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple,  easy-to-use interface to the astronomer."
257,1995 - gemini,"There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer  to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality. This simulator  should function within the virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system."
258,1995 - gemini,All control software must provide support for simulated use  within the virtual telescope
259,1995 - gemini,"There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both  within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize  observing efﬁciency. This software must consider target positions,  weather conditions, and instrument conﬁgurations"
260,1995 - gemini,"There must be software to support the ﬂexible scheduling, both  manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing  programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing  programs. This includes managing the collection of science,  environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data."
261,1995 - gemini,"Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed  observing, with similar requirements. As the costs of implementing  such a scheduler are currently difﬁcult to estimate it may prove  necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project. The system design,  if it does not include a scheduler, should speciﬁcally allow for its future  implementation."
262,1995 - gemini,"Remote operations includes both remote observing,  with the science observer offsite, and remote telescope operation, with  control of the telescope also off- site. It also covers remote eavesdropping,  monitoring, conﬁguration, and diagnosis. (There will always be support staff  on-site during observations, however.) The requirements for supporting remote  operations are:"
263,1995 - gemini,All software should be developed to permit remote operations.  There should be no conceptual difference between software working on-site  and remotely.
264,1995 - gemini,All observing facilities should work both on-site and off-site. It should  be possible to do full operations remotely
265,1995 - gemini,"Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should  be supported."
266,1995 - gemini,"It must be possible to restrict speciﬁc operations to speciﬁc remote sites. For  example, at the Mauna Kea site, remote telescope control might be restricted to Hale Pohaku.  The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic."
267,1995 - gemini,"It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been speciﬁed with sufﬁcient bandwidth to support remote operations. However, we will take advantage of commercially  available protocols such as ISDN, TCP/IP, Internet, etc."
268,1995 - gemini,"Remote control means that the function normally associated with a  local Telescope Operator, that of entering telescope control commands, would be  available from a remote site. In practice remote control will be restricted to the  Gemini 8m Telescopes Enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes Control Facility. The philosophy behind this is that, for safety considerations, telescope control commands cannot be issued  without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to:"
269,1995 - gemini,via the scheduler program and shall not control any part of the Gemini 8m  Telescopes directly.
270,1995 - gemini,In the last case they will use a remote User interface to  submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini  8m Telescopes site.
271,1995 - gemini,"Service observing implies that the Gemini staff  are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer.  A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes  that the observing program can be executed with minimal interaction with the client  astronomer. The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client  astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here. The requirements speciﬁc to service  observing are:"
272,1995 - gemini,"The observing program must be automated, requiring little human  interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software  must include a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible.  In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple,  easy-to-use interface to the astronomer."
273,1995 - gemini,"This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer,  for developing the program, and to the observer, for review and adjustment of the program.  This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment."
274,1995 - gemini,"The programming environment should allow for the  communication of special notes, instructions, and comments  from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multimedia techniques.  The use of this feature would, however, be discouraged for queue-based observing."
275,1995 - gemini,General Softwar Requirements
276,1995 - gemini,"These requirements apply to the commands and replies  between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies),  information ﬂow to and from on-line databases, and commands  and software for the IOCs."
277,1995 - gemini,"All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands  to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc.  These common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2. All IOC  subsystems must respond to additional common commands for such activities  as start, stop, initialize, reset parameters, etc. These IOC common commands  are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2."
278,1995 - gemini,"The support structure for communicating commands must be  reliable, with a uniform ACK/NAK protocol adopted across all systems.  Timeouts must be supported at approximately 500 msec."
279,1995 - gemini,"Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec,  signaling acceptance of each command."
280,1995 - gemini,"For commands allowing delayed replies, timeouts  for that reply must also be supported."
281,1995 - gemini,"The following requirements apply to the control and transfer of  astronomical data in all forms (science, engineering, reference, etc.)"
282,1995 - gemini,Data ﬂow. Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method  permitted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited  so that disk access and data transfer times are not signiﬁcant.  Maximum acceptable readout time for detector data is very dependent on detector  type and size as well as the intended application:
283,1995 - gemini,"For mosaicked, large optical detectors, a full readout of the detector  must be done in about 2 or 3 minutes."
284,1995 - gemini,"Concurrent data access and display. Since the Gemini system supports  monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple,  simultaneous access to data. Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and  attached workstations therefore imposes signiﬁcant transfer requirements on the LAN.  The LAN must support a transfer rate of 20-40 Mbits/second."
285,1995 - gemini,"Data acquisition format. Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data,  but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission  from the Gemini system or across the system LAN. The goal of compression is to minimize  bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on  removable media. For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data,  only the preprocessed data is stored."
286,1995 - gemini,"System-wide data capacity. The data capacity of the system is limited  by transfer methods and technology, as well as archiving capacity on site.  The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest  instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or  similar medium."
287,1995 - gemini,"Video information originates from target acquisition, guiding, and site  monitoring cameras. The requirements for transferring video data are:"
288,1995 - gemini,"The system must allow for fast transmission of rough images every 0.5 sec.  This may be assisted through the use of data-loss compression techniques  (e.g. JPEG, MPEG, etc)."
289,1995 - gemini,"In addition, there is the need for transmission of images matching the original  resolution. This high-quality transmission must require less than 20 sec, and can only be assisted  with loss-less compression."
290,1995 - gemini,The control software should know what subsystems are installed  and their status at all times.
291,1995 - gemini,Test and checkout Requirements
292,1995 - gemini,"Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur. This notiﬁcation must be  speciﬁc as to origin and problem. The notiﬁcation must also be capable of being electronically  logged. It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notiﬁcation such as detailed,  verbose, short, etc. to aid in tracking down problems."
293,1995 - gemini,".There should be no restrictions imposed by the software on users.  Only policy decisions (permissions, access privileges, etc.) should prevent any user  from accessing any part of the Gemini system from any local or remote station."
294,1995 - gemini,".Similar functionality should be presented to the users using similar user interfaces.  However, user interfaces should clearly reﬂect access modes and operating levels."
295,1995 - gemini,Existing external software will be integrated with the Gemini software.  The interfaces involved in this integration are considered part  of the Gemini software system.
296,1995 - gemini,Gemini software developers should maintain accurate change logs  showing software modiﬁcations as they are applied to the system software.
297,1995 - gemini,Gemini software developers should adhere to a standard method for the  reporting and recording of errors from both internal and external sources.
298,1995 - gemini,"Gemini software should be developed  in evolutionary fashion, using the CVS version control system"
299,1995 - gemini,"All Gemini subsystem packages should include as part of the software  both a simulator module for inclusion in the virtual telescope (see Design constraints, below),  and user interface modules for the user interface environments that the subsystem will be  operating in. The interfaces required of these user interface modules are described in Section  3.3 on page 3-6."
300,1995 - gemini,"All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments,  and external documentation. External documentation must  include Unix-style man pages."
301,1995 - gemini,All Gemini subsystem packages must provide modules for the testing and  diagnosis of the subsystem.
302,1995 - gemini,All instrumentation control software must provide full access to all instrument  functionality. It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present  different portions of this functionality to the user. The information required of each interface  module is found in the Functional Requirements speciﬁcations  for each instrument.
303,1995 - gemini,"All Gemini software must be version labeled, both in source and binary form.  The version information is to be retrievable from executing  software via control commands."
304,1995 - gemini,".There are different requirements for software running on different layers.  For example, strict real-time control is restricted to the IOC layer."
305,1995 - gemini,".Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible,  thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface  to the rest of the Gemini system."
306,1995 - gemini,No subsystem package should make any assumptions about the surrounding  environment beyond that provided in the interface speciﬁcations.
307,1995 - gemini,"The ﬁnal purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software is the acquisition  of astronomical data in digital form in the most efﬁcient way. To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters)  and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in  order to setup and control telescope and instruments. Additionally, video and voice data  are also necessary (for example, ﬁeld monitors)."
308,1995 - gemini,"Normally, raw data will be acquired and stored as such for quick look evaluations.  There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast preprocessing is  needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored  as such, but in a preprocessed format."
309,1995 - gemini,"Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and  the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as deﬁned by NOST 100-1.0,  “Deﬁnition of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)”, NASA Science Ofﬁce of Standards  and Technology)."
310,1995 - gemini,"Operation of telescope, instruments and subsystems can be carried out  at three different levels. There will be parameters associated with each level of operation  which deﬁne the status of the system and / or control the system. The speciﬁc access by  different types of users to particular parameters of the different levels are given in Section  2.5.8 on page 25."
311,1995 - gemini,"This allows maintenance  tables (for example, with instrument parameters) to be updated. It is anticipated that the  majority of parameters at this level will be accessed by  operations and development staff."
312,1995 - gemini,"This allows the installation and testing of new packages or new releases.  Any low level test can be performed in this mode. It shall be possible to update  all non-protected parameter values, i.e. those not used by operations at observing level. Access to this level will be extremely limited."
313,1995 - gemini,Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6  on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly  to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems  in different modes.
314,1995 - gemini,This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than  response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22). Every command must be acknowledged  in a positive or negative way before the occurrence of the corresponding action within given  response times.
315,1995 - gemini,External Iterface Requirements
316,1995 - gemini,"Main processor computer hardware requirements will be deﬁned in the Hardware  constraints (see Section 3.4.2 on page 3- 12). This section deals instead with external hardware interfaces, namely the ones from the  microprocessors to the control electronics. The deﬁnition of these terms is as follows:"
317,1995 - gemini,"microprocessors - these are computers embedded in the instrument  (for instance a DSP or transputer required for array control functions, or special  purpose controllers for the primary mirror support actuators)."
318,1995 - gemini,"Standard interfaces to the control electronics shall be available, in the form of:"
319,1995 - gemini,"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software covers all aspects of control and data  acquisition related to the telescope, instruments, and auxiliary instrumentation. It also covers all the operational aspects of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, including on-line  scheduling and rescheduling. There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes,  is referred to as external. The external software consists of:"
320,1995 - gemini,The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must interface to the external software  and clearly the interfaces are fully part of the  Gemini 8m Telescopes software.
321,1995 - gemini,"In order to make efﬁcient use of the telescope, to support different observing  modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel)  quick-look analysis is required. The following statements are proposed:"
322,1995 - gemini,"“It shall be possible to monitor the quality (image quality, spectral resolution,  signal to noise, etc.) of the astronomical data as it comes in. Standard reduction procedures should be available for basic on-line calibrations of  the observed data. Ultimately, one would like to have fully reduced and calibrated data  at the end of the observations. Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible,  at least for observations of a standard nature.”"
323,1995 - gemini,"Local coordination and synchronization needs within a  subsystem (for example, coordination of active support system  for primary mirror, bi-directional trafﬁc of commands/replies).  This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem  or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique  solution at the hardware and software level."
324,1995 - gemini,"Global synchronization needs, such as the universal time synchronization  requirement. The required accuracy will be deﬁned in Section 2.9 on  page 2- 19."
325,1995 - gemini,Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated  performance problem.
326,1995 - gemini,"Bypassing the hierarchy (connected between grandmother and granddaughter with no path through the mother) should only be used for transmission of  status information or bulk data, not control ﬂow"
327,1995 - gemini,during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs  that could beneﬁt the project
328,1995 - gemini,"Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase  when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked  against altitude and humidity speciﬁcations for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site  (see also [EDS] in Section 1.3)."
329,1995 - gemini,"Computer hardware must be able to run the Gemini 8m Telescopes software  environment (operating systems, Gemini 8m Telescopes software) and provide compatibility  in data format (identical internal data representation)."
330,1995 - gemini,.Common development and implementation tools must be both  available and supported
331,1995 - gemini,Identical network access must be supported
332,1995 - gemini,".Local processing power must be such that telescope and instrument control  does not represent a signiﬁcant overhead in the whole process of executing an observing  program (the overhead, if any, should be limited by the time it takes  for physical devices to act)"
333,1995 - gemini,"The choice of a scalable hardware architecture with computers at various  performance levels should solve the problem of adequate on-line data  assessment, as the amount of this activity is very variable and dependent upon the  kind of detector and method used."
334,1995 - gemini,".Due to the limited bandwidths which may be available remotely, there will be  constraints on the functionality of remote operations and access."
335,1995 - gemini,"Depending on funding, it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum  and a desirable speciﬁcation. The minimum situation could also coincide with what is needed in the test period before coming to full remote operation. In any case, remote  operation must include remote monitoring from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities,  together with access tools for diagnostic and test use. It should be a goal to support remote  observing from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities."
336,1995 - gemini,Some of the general requirements which have a direct effect on the software  are here explicitly transformed into software constraints. These are:
337,1995 - gemini,Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently.
338,1995 - gemini,Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical  in the upper layers (even if hardware should differ).
339,1995 - gemini,"Additions of new instruments should aim, as a goal, at introducing no modiﬁcation  to already operational parts. Modiﬁcations should be conﬁned to the operational procedures  and should not affect the bulk of the existing software."
340,1995 - gemini,.Switching to different conﬁgurations must be possible at any time with  appropriate procedures.
341,1995 - gemini,There must be easy procedures to reconﬁgure the system when subsystems  are modiﬁed or removed.
342,1995 - gemini,"The number of main packages of software must be kept to a minimum to facilitate  maintenance, but compatibly with the need to have the right degree of modularity."
343,1995 - gemini,Commercial and public domain packages should  be used whenever possible.
344,1995 - gemini,Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible.
345,1995 - gemini,Existing software expertise should be consulted whenever possible.
346,1995 - gemini,"All software which does not directly control speciﬁc hardware must be written  as machine independent, portable code. Even for microprocessor software, the  software should be hardware independent, to allow a later choice  of the target microprocessors."
347,1995 - gemini,"To allow for expansion and maintenance, Gemini 8m Telescopes standards  must be deﬁned for the on-line software and the development environment."
348,1995 - gemini,"On-line version control must be implemented. That is, the version control system  must be available to recover/restore versions at all times."
349,1995 - gemini,".At boot time, the Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall check the consistency  of versions of all the various software components."
350,1995 - gemini,".Table-driven software should be used whenever possible, to avoid unnecessary  compilations."
351,1995 - gemini,"I think you should include Rick’s information about complexity criteria here,  so show that we are aiming to achieve as simple as system as we can which meets the  requirements. — Steven."
352,1995 - gemini,A supportability plan will be part of the Gemini Control System. The goals  and issues to be addressed by this plan and the elements of the plan are detailed below. The plan is TBD.
353,1995 - gemini,translate availability and readiness requirements into  supportability requirements
354,1995 - gemini,standardization requirements
355,1995 - gemini,A reliability program is part of the Gemini Control System. The requirements  for this program and some measures of reliability are detailed below. The plan is as provided  by Glen Heriot of the Canadian Gemini Project Ofﬁce.
356,1995 - gemini,Reliability and availability Requirements
357,1995 - gemini,A detailed plan for maintaining and periodically upgrading the Control System  over its lifetime will be part of the Gemini Control System. The plan will consider:
358,1995 - gemini,Maintenance requirements including an estimate of required resources.
359,1995 - gemini,The method of upgrading the system to add capabilities and performance.  Areas where upgrades are anticipated should be identiﬁed with an estimate of the required effort and resources.
360,1995 - gemini,These issues will be addressed in the context of the mountain  environment where the system will be operating. The plan will be delivered with  the control system
361,1995 - gemini,Maintenance Requirements
362,1995 - gemini,"Monitor level Each subsystem should have a background task running whenever  that subsystem is operational, performing such tasks as checking power supply levels,  temperatures, performance, correct responses to commands. The OCS is to be notiﬁed  of any detected problems."
363,1995 - gemini,"Self-test level. Each subsystem should provide a module for fully exercising  all subsystem components, both hardware and software. This module is executed  automatically during start-up and on demand through the deﬁned interface. Problems  are to be automatically reported to the OCS via the deﬁned interface."
364,1995 - gemini,These should be done in situ during an observing session.
365,1995 - gemini,Quantitative Maintenance Requirements
366,1995 - gemini,"Quantitative maintenance requirements will be allocated to the system,  subsystems, and each component. The requirements must be achievable and stated  in such a way that veriﬁcation is permitted. The requirements will be expressed as:"
367,1995 - gemini,All equipment shall support a programmed adjustment and maintenance  interval of 30 days or longer
368,1995 - gemini,All Gemini Software must be designed with human engineering requirements  under consideration. The human engineering requirements for Gemini Software include:
369,1995 - gemini,"The Gemini Control System development effort will obey and abide by both  the letter and the spirit of all applicable engineering practices, laws, regulations, and policies.  All necessary safety approvals will be obtained before devices will be accepted.  The safety precedents and requirements are detailed below."
370,1995 - gemini,"MIL-STD-822B, System Safety Program Requirements, deﬁnes safety and risk as:"
371,1995 - gemini,Security and Safety Requirements
372,1995 - gemini,software limits - the software will not allow unsafe actions; the command  will be rejected
373,1995 - gemini,soft limit switches - the software will detect unsafe areas and halt; the software will  allow movement off of soft limits
374,1995 - gemini,software watch dogs - the software will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
375,1995 - gemini,hardware watch dogs - the system will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
376,1995 - gemini,hard limit switches - these switches will remove power from actuator when beyond  soft limits;  the software/electrical systems will allow movement off of hard limits
377,1995 - gemini,hardware interlocks - these will prevent both software and hardware from action -  there  will be no bypass of these systems
378,1995 - gemini,hard stops - the mechanism cannot move beyond this point due to mechanical  limit(s). In general hard stops  will use dampers to avoid damage to equiment.
379,1995 - gemini,All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be  passively interlocked.
380,1995 - gemini,All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be  actively  interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level
381,1995 - gemini,The precedence for conforming to safety requirements will be:
382,1995 - gemini,The general safety requirements are:
383,1995 - gemini,"A Controls Test Plan is part of the Gemini Control System. This plan will address  all areas  of testing from design, acceptance, commissioning through to hand-over. The objectives and  requirements of this plan are detailed below. MIL-STD-1309C, Deﬁnitions of terms for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment, has  these deﬁnitions:"
384,1995 - gemini,The interpretation of this table is that we should discover the failure of a  subsystem 90% of the time before the failure impacts observing.
385,1995 - gemini,"Since the Gemini software will be developed in stages over a period of years,  and since computer technology is expected to evolve rapidly over this same period,  the software is to be designed to be easily extended and upgraded with modiﬁcations  to non-changing components. The software itself, its installation process, and its  documentation must be developed with this expandability in mind, using general industry  standards."
386,1995 - gemini,"Fault tolerance. The security and safety of the system should be guaranteed  even in the event of failure of any component, including the higher-level software."
387,1995 - gemini,"Redundancy. Hardware redundancy is a not requirement of the Gemini systems.  However, the ability to reconﬁgure the software if one actuator fails is desirable.  Data redundancy is also a requirement, to prevent a single failure from causing the loss  of collected data. The goal is to minimize the effects of single-point errors throughout  the system."
388,1995 - gemini,"As much as possible, the system is to take advantage of parallel operation  to improve efﬁciency. The Telescope Control System should be capable of detecting  and invoking parallel operation as it is responsible for control of all of the telescope  and enclosure subsystems."
389,1995 - gemini,"This has to be deﬁned in [SMP] and [SCP] (see Applicable Documents, Section 1.3),  which will cover:"
390,1995 - gemini,"Emphasis on development and productivity requirements, including cross support tools"
391,1995 - gemini,Specific Requirements
392,1995 - gemini,This section presents the speciﬁc attributes and requirements for Gemini  software. Only the high-level requirements for Gemini software are presented here.   Detailed speciﬁcations for the subsystems are found in the individual chapters of the  Software Design Description.
393,1995 - gemini,The Gemini system maintenance philosophy is described in the Software  Management Plan (SMP). Preventative maintenance is scheduled as speciﬁed in the  Gemini Design Requirements Speciﬁcation.
394,1995 - gemini,Other Controls and Software Requirements
395,1995 - gemini,All telescope and instrument parameters are kept in an on line database to  permit easy implementation of table-driven  applications.  The interface between software  control packages is normally done via interface calls to the on-line  database. The requirements for this database package are:
396,1995 - gemini,The database must support both remote access and distributed data.
397,1995 - gemini,"All additional data that is not required on line (conﬁguration information, detailed  documentation, operation logs, etc.) are stored  in a relational DBMS.  (supported software)."
398,1995 - gemini,"One criteria is that sufﬁcient information be recorded during an observation  to recreate the sequence of events that  occurred during the observation.  This requires  that all  input and output data be logged appropriately. Given an initial set of conﬁguration parameters, the Gemini system operates via a  sequence of commands.  This operation  is complemented by using previously stored  data, calibrations, and star catalogs"
399,1995 - gemini,System operational requirements
400,1995 - gemini,"Performance. Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is deﬁned as  the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken  (i.e. sum of all exposure times over available time for exposures). To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system  operation should be used.  Best use of concurrency occurs  when using the Sequencer."
401,1995 - gemini,Start-up and shut-down.  There are start-up and shut-down  procedures that must exist at many different levels:
402,1995 - gemini,"Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software)  should take about 5 minutes.  This does not include time to start-up the telescope  or instruments."
403,1995 - gemini,"Warm start-up, starting from scratch but also excluding software download time  should take about 1 minute."
404,1995 - gemini,"Telescope start-up, measured from end of cold or warm start-up should be  about 4 minutes."
405,1995 - gemini,"Instrument start-up, measured from end of telescope start-up,  should take 2 minutes or less.There must be a way to shut down all subsystems  (hardware and software). All start-ups and shut-downs are to be automatically  logged with time stamps, to allow for statistics on system availability."
406,1995 - gemini,"System logging information should include all important events, properly  timestamped and indexed.  The goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation  from the system logs."
407,1995 - gemini,It must be possible to log engineering data at up to 200 Hz rates for short  periods of time. This data must be available to external software  packages for analysis.
408,1995 - gemini,"Long-term logging of engineering data must be possible at slower (1 Hz or less)  rates, into a common format (baselined as SYBASE)."
409,1995 - gemini,"Fatal  Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will  allow operation to proceed.  Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a  safe ""backup"" state requiring human intervention for restart."
410,1995 - gemini,"Serious Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but  the current operation cannot be completed.   Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation."
411,1995 - gemini,"Recovery  In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-deﬁned recovery  procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative. Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or noresponse  conditions.  These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid  unnecessary error conditions."
412,1995 - gemini,"Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down  and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be  possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations  that do not require that particular instrument"
413,1995 - gemini,"For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded  performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking;  other errors may result in operation with a different instrument"
414,1995 - gemini,"Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small.   The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase  might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate.    Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems  before reaching the OCS level."
415,1995 - gemini,"Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem  should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links."
416,1995 - gemini,"Functional analysis is done using a CASE tool suitable for use with  Ward/Mellor techniques, such as TSEE, by Westmount Technologies. The design is to use the techniques and diagrams introduced by  Ward and Mellor and  reviewed by the Gemini staff. Detailed design and development standards are not speciﬁed,  but expected to conform  to system goals and established  practice. An object-oriented approach is encouraged but not required."
417,1995 - gemini,"The upper levels (User-interface and OCS) are assumed to not require a  real-time operating environment.  However, the operating environment at these levels  is expected to provide sufﬁcient performance for both human interaction and communications. Real-time support is required at the IOC level."
418,1995 - gemini,Some packages (such as GUI interfaces and database interfaces) have higher  portability requirements that may require the speciﬁcation  of higher level interfaces to the OS.
419,1995 - gemini,The GNU software tool suite should be used where possible.
420,1995 - gemini,The IOCs will use the real-time operating system VxWorks  (from Wind River Systems).
421,1995 - gemini,"The communication software must support the standard ARPA services  (telnet, FTP, SMTP, etc) as well as NFS, RPC, IPC, and  the Unix socket interface library."
422,1995 - gemini,"Off line Data reduction.  The off-line data reduction facility is not considered part  of the Gemini software.   However, it will be possible to connect such software into the  Gemini system if interface routines are developed for connecting to the Gemini system.    These interface routines are part of the Gemini software and must conform to the standards  given in this document.  Packages that might be used for off-line data reduction include  ADAM, IRAF, Midas, IDL and Khoros."
423,1995 - gemini,Quick-look analysis will be through PV-Wave/IDL.
424,1995 - gemini,Archiving.  All astronomical data are saved into the Archiving system.  Data storage  and transport for astronomical data will be in FITS format.  On-line access to the archiver  will be through STARCAT.
425,1995 - gemini,".Star catalogs.  The catalogs available on the Gemini system are described in  TBD, as are software access  requirements.  Both on-line and off-line access is done  according to STARCAT."
426,1995 - gemini,The computer hardware used for development must conform to  the following:
427,1995 - gemini,"Workstations must match speciﬁed software standards and present a well-designed  development environment, including cross-support for  VxWorks development, if needed."
428,1995 - gemini,Internal data formats must be compatible across workstations  used for development.
429,1995 - gemini,".Reliability, manufacturer support, and upgrade capability of the development  systems will be considered when selecting the ﬁnal target systems."
430,1995 - gemini,"All accesses to the control electronics hardware will be  through VME IOC's,  using the EPICS software.  No other control interfaces are permitted."
431,1995 - gemini,All communication hardware must meet the data ﬂow requirements  and software protocols deﬁned in this document.  The following recommendations  are based on currently available technology.  It is entirely appropriate that changes  will be  made to take advantages of changes to that technology.
432,1995 - gemini,"The detector LAN is also based on Ethernet, at least for the development systems.   A solution meeting the performance requirements of the ﬁnal system is to be  decided later."
433,1995 - gemini,The backbone LAN cannot be Ethernet because of bandwidth requirements.   A FDDI system is recommended for the backbone LAN.
434,1995 - gemini,Cabling of LANs is shown in Figure 4 - 1.  Also shown are cabling requirements  to the base facility.  Requirements for cabling are given in the Electronic  Design Speciﬁcation.
435,1995 - gemini,Interlock connections must be provided for all critical subsystems.   The software interface to the interlock system is deﬁned in the Instrument  Control System Infrastructure Work Package Deﬁnition.
436,1995 - gemini,"Links to the WAN are deﬁned in the Electronic Design Speciﬁcation and  shown in Figure 4 - 1, above.  There is a requirement of at least one dedicated link  of a T1 bandwidth for remote support, development and testing."
437,1995 - gemini,User Requirements for EPICS developers
438,1995 - gemini,"All other software components are optional. Of course any application  developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM). Likewise an  application developer would not start from scratch developing record and device  support. Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used. Likewise any given record  support module, device support module, or driver could be deleted from a particular  IOC and EPICS will still function."
439,1995 - gemini,Each of the Gemini Controls work packages will be involved with some  aspect of EPICS development ranging from creation of new device drivers to database  creation and the design of new CA clients.The details of the EPICS work required can be  broken down into several broad categories which reﬂect the nature of the various work  packages. This breakdown is given in the following subsections:
440,1995 - gemini,"Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors Gemini will not modify the heart of EPICS. We leave this to Los Alamos."
441,1995 - gemini,"Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.) Neither will Gemini plan on creating new development tools."
442,1995 - gemini,For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes  Project the following deﬁnitions will be used to differentiate  between the two ﬂavors of EPICS development work:
443,1995 - gemini,The ﬁrst two items would be suitable topics for an advanced EPICS  course on EPICS System Development. The latter two items would be covered  under Advanced Application Development and a case can probably be made  that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled  something like ‘Internals - Tools’
444,1995 - gemini,Required developer skills
445,1995 - gemini,For each class of developer a speciﬁc set of skills is required.  The following sections list those that would be commonly used.
446,1995 - gemini,This section presents the “generic” commands that all Gemini systems  must respond to. There are also “Control Commands” common to all Gemini systems  to provide speciﬁc functionality during observing. These control commands are presented  in the Gemini Software Design Description. Speciﬁc commands are presented in the Software  Design Descriptions for the individual subsystems.
447,1995 - gemini,Time synchronization is commonly required among control subsystems.  These commands are to permit appropriate time synchronizations. Times will be  provided in IRIG-B format as UTC. TBD
448,1995 - gemini,Some subsystems may need to obtain information from other systems  within the Gemini control system. This access is accomplished using the same  communication and database access commands as given above.
449,1995 - gemini,"Details of the implementation are the province of the OCS work package  developers, who are responsible for providing procedures for  constructing/deconstructing/routing command strings.  The mappings of speciﬁc IOC commands between ASCII strings and EPICS channel access  calls are determined by the individual IOC subsystem developers. Work Package  Descriptions include baseline command descriptions that  need to be implemented for that speciﬁc work package."
450,1998 - themas,THEMAS The Energy Management System SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
451,1998 - themas,The following subsections of Section 1.0 provide an overview of the entire Software Requirements Specification.
452,1998 - themas,SRS Software Requirements Specification
453,1998 - themas,"The following documents shown form a part of this specification. In the event of conflict between the documents referenced and the contents of this SRS, the contents of this document shall overrule all others, with the exception of the Statement of Work."
454,1998 - themas,ANSI/IEE Guide to Software ANSI/IEEE STD 830-1984 Requirements Specification
455,1998 - themas,"This section of this SRS describes the general factors that effect the THEMAS system and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements, it only makes these requirements easier understood."
456,1998 - themas,"The THEMAS system is a system that operates independent of any other system, or any components of the heating and cooling system to which it is attached. The THEMAS system, however, is composed mainly of a hardware and software portion. This SRS only specifies the requirements dealing with the software portion of the system. If assumptions or dependencies about the hardware were made, they are stated in this section of the SRS."
457,1998 - themas,"The THEMAS system is divided into four major sections: Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Initialize System, and System Reports. All four sections have an associated software configuration item; all except the System Reports have an associated hardware configuration item. The hardware requirements are contained in the system specification. The functions of the software for the system are contained in the following paragraphs."
458,1998 - themas,"The general constraints of the THEMAS system focus on the functionality provided by the external devices connected to i t. The thermostats shall only provide temperature values and temperature settings. The heating and cooling units provide no feedback to the THEMAS system. When a signal is sent to a heating or cooling unit, no signal shall be available to allow the THEMAS system to determine if the signal sent to the unit was realized by the unit."
459,1998 - themas,"In developing the requirements for the THEMAS system, several assumptions have been made about the thermostat hardware and the heating/cooling hardware. These assumptions are stated in the following paragraphs."
460,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall be designed to run on the Microsoft ® Windows NT™ operating system. All the internal process communications shall be designed to operate on this operating system. Any communication with the thermostats and heating and cooling units shall be done through the interface to these units. These interfaces shall run on this operating system as well.
461,1998 - themas,It is assumed that the heating/cooling unit is incapable of returning its current off/on status to the THEMAS system. The heating/cooling unit has no real time delay when sending these statuses to the THEMAS system. The heating/cooling unit shall have the capability of being turned off and on by the supervisor of the THEMAS system.
462,1998 - themas,Engineering Requirements
463,1998 - themas,"This section is subdivided into ten main subsections: Initialize Operational Parameters, Initialize System, Validate Temperature, Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Generate H/C Signal, Generate Alarm Data, Generate Event Data, Change Thermostat Setting, and Generate Reports. Each subsection describes the software requirement for that individual software component of the THEMAS system."
464,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall control t he heating and cooling units that are defined as part of the THEMAS system. The definitions of the individual heating and cooling systems reside in an initialization file. The system shall read this file and the definitions shall be derived from the initialization data in the file.
465,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall use the information contained in the initialization data file to determine which heating and cooling units are part of the THEMAS system. Ther e is one heating and cooling unit that corresponds to one thermostat in each of four quadrants on each of three floors of the office building.
466,1998 - themas,Each thermostat shall have a unique identifier by which that thermostat is identified in the THEMAS system. This procedure will load these definitions into the THEMAS software.
467,1998 - themas,Each quadrant of each floor shall have a thermostat which is to be used to provide temperature data to the THEMAS system. The initialization file shall contain a unique identifier for each thermostat that the system is to monitor. These identifiers shall be read from the initialization file and loaded into the THEMAS system during the initialization process.
468,1998 - themas,There shall be a maximum number of heating or cooling u nits that can be on at any given time. This procedure loads the maximum number of concurrently running units allowed.
469,1998 - themas,The maximum number of heating or cooling units that can run concurrently shall reside in an initialization file. The maximum number of concurrently running units shall be read from the initialization file and stored in the THEMAS system.
470,1998 - themas,The trigger value is used in combination with the current temperature to determine when a heating or cooling unit shall be turned on or off.
471,1998 - themas,The trigger values shall reside in an initialization file. This procedure shall read the initialization file and establish the trigger value from the data in that file.
472,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall ensure the temperature reported by a given thermostat shall not exceed a maximum deviation value of 3 degrees Fahrenheit.
473,1998 - themas,The overtemperature values shall reside in an initialization file. This procedure shall read the initialization file and establish the overtemperature value from the data in that file.
474,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall only respond to temperatures that are within a reasonable value.
475,1998 - themas,The valid temperature range value shall reside in an initialization file. This procedure shall read the initialization file and establish the valid temperature range from the data in it.
476,1998 - themas,"When the THEMAS system is initialized, it shall first turn off all the heating and cooling units. Then , it shall check all the thermostats and determine if any thermostat’s settings require a heating or cooling unit to be turned on back on."
477,1998 - themas,"This process shall first determine a known state of all the heating and cooling units by issuing a request to turn off all the units. It shall then read the current temperature values and current temperature settings of each thermostat. If the settings reflect a need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned o n, the process shall issue a request to turn on the appropriate unit. This determination shall be made in accordance with the rules outlined in section 3.1.4.1 and 3.1.4.2."
478,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall only respond to temperatures from the thermostats that are within the specified valid range.
479,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall determine wh en a reported temperature or a changed temperature setting exceeds the limits set by the overtemperature values. Temperatures that exceed the overtemperature limits shall be reported as such. Temperatures that do not exceed these limits shall be output for subsequent processing.
480,1998 - themas,"When the current temperature value exceeds the current temperature setting by a pre -defined amount, the THEMAS system shall activate the appropriate heating or cooling unit.s"
481,1998 - themas,The THEMAS system shall control each of the heating and cooling units that are defined for the system. The THEMAS system shall limit the number of heating or cooling units t hat may be running simultaneously.

An  EIRENE  system  may  also  include optional  features  and  these  shall  then  be  implemented  as  specified  in  the EIRENE FRS and SRS. The EIRENE System includes terminals."
1317,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"A  UIC  fiche  or  leaflet  is  a  document  adopted  by  UIC  members.  Statements within the fiche may comprise specifications which are binding on UIC members (�obligatory�  specifications)  or  optional  (�recommended�  specifications).  The existing track-to-train radio standard is contained within UIC fiche 751-3. It is envisaged that the EIRENE standard will be covered by a new UIC fiche, 751-4."
1318,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,A Secondary Controller is a train controller who holds responsibility for the safe running  of  trains  on  a  designated  area  of  track  (e.g.  a  signaller).  Secondary Controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in order to perform their function. The split of responsibilities between Primary Controllers and Secondary Controllers is determined on a national basis.

1718,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"Display the queue to the controller, showing the functional identity and priority of  callers.  High  priority calls  should be  identified  and  presented  at the  top  of  the  queue."
1719,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"8.2.2     For post incident analysis, the controller equipment should provide the possibility to  record all operational speech and data calls. (O)"
1720,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,8.2.3     It should be possible for calls to be answered automatically according to incoming call  priority as defined in section 10.2. (O)
1721,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"8.3.1     The functionality required by other types of controllers is essentially the same as for  primary controllers, but the control area will differ and the call set-up subsystem may  be integrated into their own function management system. (I)"
1722,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"8.3.2     At  the  detailed  level,  different  controllers  may  have  specific  addressing  needs,  eg  catering controllers will need to call specific vehicles in a train. (I)"
1723,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,8.4.1     The  communications  architecture  will  be  dictated  by  local  circumstances.  The  definition of this interface is beyond the scope of EIRENE. (I)
1724,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"8.5.1     The controller equipment must be designed to function correctly in a railway operating  environment, such as control centres and signal boxes. (I)"
1725,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.1.1     International  standardisation  of numbering  plans  is  needed  to  ensure  interworking  between  networks.  Furthermore,  standardised  allocation  of  numbers  to  subscribers  will facilitate schemes for identification, barring, etc. (I)"
1726,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,9.2     Numbering plan requirements
1727,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,9.2.1.1     The  EIRENE  system  shall  enable  users  to  originate  and  receive  calls  by  functional  number. (M)

1736,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,9.2.4.4     The numbering for other teams shall be treated in the same way as maintenance teams  in 9.2.4.2. (M)
1737,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,9.2.5.1     Group  call  service  areas  shall  be  freely  configurable  within  the  operational  responsibility of each railway network. (M)
1738,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.2.6.1     In some countries, train numbers are alphanumeric. Support for such numbers is not  required for interoperability. (I)"
1739,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.3.1     Telephone numbers can be defined on a national basis, but codes for certain functions  shall be used on an international basis in order to allow interoperability. (M)"
1740,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.3.2     For certain functions, standardised telephone numbers shall be implemented. These  functions are: (M)  -     Route call to most appropriate ERTMS/ETCS RBC;  -     Railway emergency call;  -     Route call to primary controller;  -     Route call to secondary controller;  -     Route call to power supply controller;  -     Public emergency call."
1741,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.4.1     To provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the EIRENE  network, standardisation of UIC group numbering will be required. (I)"
1742,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"9.4.2     In network boundary areas, the pre-defined local area shall be allocated on a bilateral  basis. (M)"
1743,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,9.5.1     Authorised users within the EIRENE network shall be able to receive calls from calling  parties outside the EIRENE network. (M)
1744,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.2.1     A number of levels of priority shall be required in order to offer different grades of  service to different users and calls. Five levels of priority shall be defined: (M)
1745,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.2.3     The lowest priority ongoing call shall be pre-empted before that of a higher priority.  (M)
1746,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.3.2     Any  implementation  of  such  call  restrictions  shall  not  affect  international  interoperability. (M)
1747,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.4.1     A mobile may be a member of a number of groups. It shall be possible to activate or  deactivate the mobiles subscription to these groups. (M)
1748,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.4.2     Activating a group on the mobile shall allow a user to receive a call from that group.  (M)
1749,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.4.3     Deactivating  a  group  on  the  mobile  shall  prevent  a  user  receiving  calls  from  that  group. (M)
1750,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"10.4.4     In  order  to  provide  interoperability,  Cab  radios  will  be  members  of  a  number  of  standard groups:"

1752,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,10.5.1     Authorised networks shall be listed (or automatically selected if automatic selection  has been enabled) in the following order: (M)
1753,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"10.5.2     Where EIRENE facilities are not available within the currently selected network, the  user shall be given a visible indication. (M)"
1754,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"10.6.3     If required, a railway may make additional restrictions to the access matrix. (O)"
1755,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.1.1     There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a functional number  rather than a telephone number. Such numbers are generally only associated with a  user for a limited period of time. (I)
1756,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.1 An  addressing  scheme  shall  be  provided  which  permits  users  to  be  identified  by     numbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to the  terminal equipment that they are using. (M)
1757,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.2 The  primary  usage  of  functional  addressing  will  be  for  controllers  to  establish     communications  with  train  drivers  by  making  use  of  the  train  number.  The  train  number will vary between journeys although EIRENE equipment in the cab is unlikely  to change. (I)
1758,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.1.3 Other  uses  of  functional  addressing  will  include  identifying  on-train  functions  and     other users performing particular roles such as shunting team leaders, maintenance  team members, etc. (I)"
1759,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.4 It shall be possible to assign up to a minimum of 3 functional numbers to an EIRENE     user at any one time. (M)
1760,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.5 Only one EIRENE user shall be assigned to a given functional number at any one time.     (M)
1761,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.1.7 A user shall be able to set up a functional number on one network, and cancel the     number from another network. (M)"
1762,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.8 The  functional  number  shall  remain  valid  as  a  user  roams  from  one  network  to     another. (M)
1763,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.1.9 The functional addressing scheme shall be independent of specific configurations of     mobile and terminal equipment. For example, the functional number of a conductor on  board  a  particular  train  shall  be  the  same  irrespective  of  whether  the  conductor  accesses  the  network  through  the  Cab  radio  or  has  a  separate  dedicated  EIRENE  mobile. (M)"
1764,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.1.10It shall be possible to call EIRENE users by functional numbers from a wide range of     terminals (EIRENE and non-EIRENE). Examples include EIRENE mobiles, controller  terminals, railway fixed network telephones and public telephones. (All such calls will  be subject to any access restrictions  see section 10.3.) (M)"
1765,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.1.11The functional addressing scheme should permit calls to be routed from a controller to     an international train within the control area without reference to any EIRENE system  other than that providing service to the international train. (O)
1766,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.2.1 Functional numbers must be unique within the domain of operation. Since the number     must be independent of networks, each number must be unique across all networks  (including implementation of EIRENE facilities on public networks). (M)"
1767,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.2.2 The functional number shall consist of numeric characters only. (M)
1768,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.2.3 If  alphanumeric  numbers  are  applied  by  a  national  railway,  the  railway  will  be     responsible for the translation to unique numeric functional numbers compatible with  the EIRENE specification. (I)"
1769,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.3.1 The functional identity of the called user shall be presented to the user initiating a call     and the functional identity of the initiator shall be presented to the user receiving a call.  (M)
1770,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.3.2 For broadcast and group voice communications, the functional identity provided shall     be that of the broadcast or group identity. (M)"
1771,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.3.3 If the user initiating the call has more than one functional identity, the user shall be     able to select, prior to call establishment, which functional identity is presented to the  receiving user. (M)"
1772,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.2.3.4 In the case of Cab radio, when a train number is assigned as a functional identity, this     shall take priority over other Cab radio functional identities, and shall be the functional  identity for the Cab radio to be displayed to other users. (M)"
1773,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.2.3.5 The functional identity shall be presented to the user in a form which can be readily     understood (eg driver of train abcd rather than abcd01 or xyz shunting team 3  rather than xyz03). (M)
1774,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.2.1 The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straightforward procedure     for registration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the user  on commencement of the functional role. (M)
1775,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.2.2 The  functional  number  registration  facility  shall  be  supported  by  all  EIRENE  user     equipment. (M)
1776,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.3.2.2i It should be possible for the system to prevent certain types of users from registering  functional numbers that they are not authorised to use, for example: (O)"
1777,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.2.3 It shall be possible to register up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment     physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds. (M)
1778,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.2.4 The  registration  procedure  shall  provide  a  means  to  prevent  mis-allocation  of     functional numbers during registration. (M)
1779,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.2.5 Duplicate  functional  numbers  (eg  two  trains  with  the  same  train  number)  shall  be     prevented. (M)
1780,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.3.2.6 The system shall provide a means to recover consistent data sets following a system     failure  during  which  functional  addressing  facilities  are  lost.  During  this  recovery  period, the system shall not permit the use of unverified functional numbers. (M)"
1781,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.3.1 The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straightforward procedure     for deregistration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the  user at the end of the functional role. (M)
1782,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.3.2 The functional number deregistration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user     equipment. (M)
1783,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.3.3.3 It shall be possible to deregister up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment     physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds. (M)

1790,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,11.4.2     The functions to which calls shall be routed based upon the location of the mobile shall  include: (M)
1791,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.4.3     The correspondence between the locations and the destination of the call shall be easily  re-configurable  to  support  dynamic  changes  in  controller  area  boundaries  (eg  controller  area  boundaries  will  change  from  peak  to  off-peak  periods  during  the  working day or over longer periods, areas may change to match changes in railway  organisation or traffic demand).

1795,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,"11.4.7     Where  greater  accuracy  for  location  dependent  addressing  is  required,  additional  location information may be provided by systems external to EIRENE. Sources of such  information may include: (O)  a)  ground-based signalling systems;  b)  on-train systems (eg ERTMS/ETCS equipment, balise readers, GPS etc)."
1796,2007-eirene_fun_7-2,12.1.1     There is a requirement that the EIRENE system can be used as a bearer to support an  application connected to the radio for exchange of text messages between ground and  mobile(s) or mobile and ground. (I)

2091,2008 - keepass,Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe
2092,2008 - keepass,· When writing this document it was inherited that all requirements have the same priority. · First there is presented an overall view about KeePass and then all features and functions are analyzed in detail.
2093,2008 - keepass,"This requirement document contains general information about KeePass, main classes and use cases, functions, features and special technologies. It describes in detail all that KeePass needs to work properly and with safety. The rest of the document is divided into chapters for better understanding."
2094,2008 - keepass,"In chapter 2 an overall description of KeePass is provided. First product perspective is presented with product features and main functions. Then follow user classes and characteristics, operating environments that KeePass supports as well as design and implementation constraints. After all that user documentation is presented and will provide you with more details about each feature’s technology."
2095,2008 - keepass,"In chapter 3 most important features are presented with detailed description, use cases and requirements."
2096,2008 - keepass,In chapter 5 requirements about safety and performance are presented.
2097,2008 - keepass,"Entry – Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes. Not all fields are required for an entry. An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button."
2098,2008 - keepass,Auto-Type The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser.
2099,2008 - keepass,"Composite Master Key To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created. All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database. So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database."
2100,2008 - keepass,"URL Field The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined. In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports. URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs. Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed."
2101,2008 - keepass,Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature. This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized. So to unlock it the Master Key is required again. The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu.
2102,2008 - keepass,System features are organized by use cases and functional hierarchy so that the main functions of the system will be understandable.
2103,2008 - keepass,It is the first thing a user must do to begin using KeePass. Its main function is the determination of the master password that will unlock the database from now on
2104,2008 - keepass,REQ-1: KeePass must be downloaded and installed
2105,2008 - keepass,"When choosing to open a database a user is transferred to his documents where he navigates to find the database he wants. When the database is found, the master password is wanted so that the database will be unlocked. Once this is done the user is free to access his data."
2106,2008 - keepass,Folder selected must be of type the database can read and that is “name”.kdb
2107,2008 - keepass,Databases must have different names or else the previews one will be replace if selected
2108,2008 - keepass,There must be entries in the database in order for them to be printed
2109,2008 - keepass,"There is the ability to search in the database for usernames, groups, passwords, URLs, notes and titles. This is very useful when the user needs to find out very quickly which password is required in one account or what username he has put on another account. It is not necessary to write in the search field all characters. By writing just one character the database will present all data which contains it or are related with it."
2110,2008 - keepass,"All data related to the word must be shown. For example if user types “abc” and abc is part of a password and of a username, both entries must be shown"
2111,2008 - keepass,There is the ability to organize data into groups and subgroups. The user can create a new group or subgroups into an existing group. When creating a group/subgroup the user must select a name and then he can add entries into it.
2112,2008 - keepass,A name is required in order for the new group/subgroup to be created
2113,2008 - keepass,A name is required in order for the group/subgroup to be renamed
2114,2008 - keepass,"When a user wants to delete an existing group/subgroup he can do this by selecting Delete group/subgroup from the edit menu. In order for that to happen, he must have chosen first a group/subgroup."
2115,2008 - keepass,User selects the fields which will be searched
2116,2008 - keepass,In order to find something in a group a word must be placed in the find field
2117,2008 - keepass,A message appears “the repeated password must be identical with the password
2118,2008 - keepass,An entry must belong to a group to be created
2119,2008 - keepass,When the password field is completed the repeat password field must be completed
2120,2008 - keepass,REQ-13: Password field and repeat password field must be identical
2121,2008 - keepass,"The user can modify the context of an entry he already has added. This can be done by selecting view/edit entry. In order for that to happen, the user must select an entry first. When he does this, the form he filled in when he created or last modified the entry open. Then the user can change the group, title, user name, password, URL, notes, expiration date and attachment file. His changes are saved by clicking OK."
2122,2008 - keepass,ìAn entry must be selected to be viewed or modified
2123,2008 - keepass,ìWhen the password field is changed the repeat password field must be Changed and be identical with password field
2124,2008 - keepass,An entry must be selected before it is duplicated
2125,2008 - keepass,REQ-17: An entry must be selected to be deleted
2126,2008 - keepass,"REQ-18: An internet connection and a browser are required in order to download new language translations For the following features, use cases are not included"
2127,2008 - keepass,This feature allows user to define a sequence of keypresses which KeePass will automatically perform.
2128,2008 - keepass,The prefix “Auto-Type:” is required in front of each sequence
2129,2008 - keepass,Sequence’s length must not be more than a line (59 characters)
2130,2008 - keepass,This feature allows user to pass a file patch in the command line so that KeePass will open it immediately after start up.
2131,2008 - keepass,"In case a space is found in the path, it must be enclosed into quotes"
2132,2008 - keepass,This feature is a composition of master password and key files and all its composites are required so that the database can be unlocked.
2133,2008 - keepass,"If a master password is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t open unless the password is entered"
2134,2008 - keepass,"If a key file is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t open unless the key file is present"
2135,2008 - keepass,"If there is a composite key, both master password and key file are required"
2136,2008 - keepass,Internet connection and a browser are required in order for several functions to be executed such as downloading plug-ins
2137,2008 - keepass,"When a password is copied, it remains on memory for only 10 seconds. If in the meanwhile it is not pasted anywhere, it must be copied again. That happens so that if user copies a password and not paste it anywhere, the password cannot be found by anyone later."
2138,2008 - keepass,KeePass is a small and light project so it does not need to be installed. All it takes is unpacking from the Zip package. It can be transferred also in a USB stick with no additional  configuration needed.
2139,2008 - peering,Software Requirements   Specification   for   Internetworking of   Content Delivery Networks   through Peering
2140,2008 - peering,"CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale       and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise. It is formed by a set of       autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure       for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers. It is expected that an effective peering       arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur."
2141,2008 - peering,It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.
2142,2008 - peering,It passes the service requirements to the PA.
2143,2008 - peering,"It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs."
2144,2008 - peering,Service registration is triggered when either one of the following occurs: (a) resources           are available as a provider starts operating; (b) previously registered resource           information needs to be updated; (c) available local resource information is required in           the event of traffic surges; and (d) local and delegated external resource information is           to be encapsulated in an SR instance included in an established peering arrangement.
2145,2008 - peering,There is an established norm that any resource failure will be reported
2146,2008 - peering,SR: Sends resource and access information.           PR: Sends policy information for establishing negotiated relationships           PA: Receives service requirements from the mediator.
2147,2008 - peering,"Upon receiving the initialization request to trigger peering, the mediator generates           service requirements and passes it to local PA."
2148,2008 - peering,Service requirements are generated and they are sent to the local PA.
2149,2008 - peering,The mediator generates service requirements.
2150,2008 - peering,"If the service requirements are acceptable according to the provider’s policy, mediator passes it to the local PA."
2151,2008 - peering,"If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service           requirements are not passed to the local PA."
2152,2008 - peering,The format of service requirements is defined.
2153,2008 - peering,Service requirements are received from the mediator.
2154,2008 - peering,Local PA receives service requirements from the mediator.
2155,2008 - peering,"Else, mediator re-evaluates service requirements and sends to the local PA to perform re-negotiation."
2156,2008 - peering,There could be circumstances under which a given peering arrangement may need to disband or rearranges         itself. This feature is associated with the use case shown in Figure 7.
2157,2008 - peering,"This section describes the logical characteristics of each interface between the intended software     product and the users. For user interface design, common GUI standards will be followed along with     the presence of keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards etc., and standard buttons and     functions (i.e. help) will appear on every screen. Details of the user interface design are intended to be     documented in a separate user interface specification."
2158,2009 - peppol approved,"Functional and non-functional requirements   specification for the VCD, including critical   synthesis, comparison and assessment of   national vs. pan-European needs"
2159,2009 - peppol approved,The executive summary will be elaborated and improved in the upcoming Version 1.2.
2160,2009 - peppol approved,The conclusions will be amended in the upcoming Version 1.2 of D 2.1.
2161,2009 - peppol approved,The VCD schema specification comprised of a logical data model and a physical         representation in XML will be the standard format to ensure interoperable VCD package         implementation.
2162,2009 - peppol approved,"Besides above technical specifications, the evaluation of legal compliance of these technical         specifications is performed. The results of these evaluations will be fed into the specifications         of the components indicated above."
2163,2009 - peppol approved,"Likewise, organisational specifications will detail the processes of interaction between users,         the scenarios for the production pilots, test and evaluation guidelines as well as business         models of pilots, and governance and maintenance structures to ensure long-term         sustainability."
2164,2009 - peppol approved,"1. The VCD will support any authorised entities (economic operator, intermediary, contracting           authority or IT service such as an eTendering system) in creating an electronic information           package consisting of the required documentation, evidences, proof, attestations, certificates,           declarations and metadata."
2165,2009 - peppol approved,"2. In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and           attestations from existing registries. It also enables the economic operator to add self-declarations           or other documents of formal qualification."
2166,2009 - peppol approved,"3. Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling           them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any           contracting authority in Europe."
2167,2009 - peppol approved,4. In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their           eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic           operator.
2168,2009 - peppol approved,5. Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted           by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled           by the economic operator.
2169,2009 - peppol approved,"6. For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of           high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are           precise, up-to-date, available and reliable."
2170,2009 - peppol approved,documents that must be accessed by the contracting authority from the official source.
2171,2009 - peppol approved,The following preconditions and assumptions that define the context of VCD Services and VCD         Packages should be taken into consideration:
2172,2009 - peppol approved,"Criteria for qualification and selection are in accordance with the Directives 2004/18/EC4,5(public             procurement) and 2004/17/EC6 (utilities), and are used to map among national requirements."
2173,2009 - peppol approved,One criterion may require one or more attestations in order to be proved
2174,2009 - peppol approved,In accordance to the above mentioned major visions and requirements two important dimensions are         to be considered in order to assess the benefits of a VCD Service and a VCD Package (cf. Figure 3):
2175,2009 - peppol approved,"The contracting authority may control whether or not the evidences prove the required criteria (as               opposed to the level of compilation support, where one only could check if the VCD is complete               and the attestations are valid)."
2176,2009 - peppol approved,An economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the             requirements (what criteria have to be fulfilled) and decide which are the best national attestations             (self declarations included) to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority.
2177,2009 - peppol approved,The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted             attestations express fulfilment with the relevant criteria or requirements.
2178,2009 - peppol approved,"Major Features, Requirements and Quality Attributes"
2179,2009 - peppol approved,A standard representation of common criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion MUST be           defined according to Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC.
2180,2009 - peppol approved,The right granularity and consistency of criteria MUST be found through testing and iterative redefinition               in order to ensure legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results.
2181,2009 - peppol approved,Input will come from the Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC
2182,2009 - peppol approved,Superset of evidences: The formal representation will become necessary as a reference data set               for the mapping operations showing the relationship between all attestations.
2183,2009 - peppol approved,Subset of evidences: The input for the current function (mapping) comes from specific “Calls for               Tenders” which therewith represent tender-specific requirements.
2184,2009 - peppol approved,National requirements of qualitative selection and exclusion for qualitative selection and exclusion           have to adequately represent the national legal conditions. They have to be formulated in a way that           they can be mapped to common European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion mentioned by           the Articles 45-50.
2185,2009 - peppol approved,National requirements for qualitative selection and exclusion MUST correspond to the EC criteria               given in Article 45-50.
2186,2009 - peppol approved,National criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion SHOULD have the right granularity and               should be consistent among themselves.
2187,2009 - peppol approved,"In a first step, all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant           EU directive 2004/18/EC to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria. To ensure a           degree of comparability and reliability among the results, the mapping should be based on a common           template.
